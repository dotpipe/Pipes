origin opacity: nearly all languages except for PHP include threading.

I am well, To understand this, I will compensate for much within a time requisite to not let this be TL;DR from the start. I am wishing for this to be quite open of technological telemetry. Aside from some scapes, this will ride as a perfectly useable threading mechanism.

Using multiple files, held under requisite of number of recursions necessary, likely finding the need of 2, or at most the count of 3. This will all ride on current PHP background information and be without the use of external, or outside commands from the command line. We will not be using exec(), natively. these arguments are going to be rerouted through the recursions. And when they are used, they will be nested, and given back to the page being used dynamically to keep the information concurrent. This is a concurrent method.

With using a FLAG bit, like in any other threading situation, as a semaphore block, the threading will begin as it is to start with it's lock being off, but then revisited as 1 when the new semaphore is installed in the thread. By aligning with a single bit, a fully recognizable increment at this point, we can see which recursion we are settled into. This is on the client side. The client is unaware.

When we switch between recursions, the blocking begins to have its reasoning. A second bit of the FLAG byte, turned on, is used to recall the certitude of the thread's end. When all cases of the thread have been ergodic, then it will be off again. As we recede from the thread, all lanes have been recovered. This means, that if the thread is not destroyed, as told by the send FLAG bit, then the session will be considered corrupt, and the user will be logged out, to an error message.


Recursion control:

When a thread line is being used and the first FLAG bit is made 1, then it will release back to the client-side system. Since this may or may not end the thread, the semaphore's second FLAG bit will need to be recognized as the most important factor to reveal if A. debugging is done correctly, and B. is the thread truly over. One would likely send back an array from a Pipes request. If not then it can be just returned in the last motion of the thread's work.

By passing that we are using the same session id, we can have control over the JSON file we must have produced to create the most detailed forms of security in our threading. This is a good way to create holes in the security of the computer if someone is sniffing what is going on in the JSON. So, to run it more securely, we can use chmod to turn on and turn off throughout use of write controls. I am positive this activated detail will give you an advantage over the hackers if they have not gotten to your account. Also, passing arbitrary information through POST calls will make the defintion of security easier for us to see and make ubiquitous. 

There is a reason to see if you have a semaphore still working on the thread. Any blocking done will keep the threading going. Whether the first FLAG bit is 0 or 1 we only see whether this portion, the active thread, is installed. The second FLAG bit is after cleanup routines. If the information is in JSON format (.json) the file associated to it must be created and given to the hard disk of the host. And when time is given back to the thread (via proxy through a wait timer in a second file.) it will recreate the system environment it had so it can unlink() the JSON and work with it. This keeps the file on the hard disk for a minimal time. chmod is still playing an important role, but likely of that of writing to. Deleting the file while reading it, will and should show of some course, that the file is under watchful reproach and be suspect to the host administrator. So a detailed service message to the admin will likely be necessary; as anyone trying to reveal a file that exists for milliseconds or maybe 10 seconds at most, will be something to be cautious of. If at all possible, these files are recommended as security flaws, judging the deference to the resource.

After all of this, to this point, we see that the articulation of the FLAG bits are to be as important to be commanded as the thread is. If the thread cannot be contacted for some time, the system will bring the user an error message. Where and how this is done is completely within the hands of the programmer and/or administrator. If there is an error during the unlink() command, then the work is to be cut off and left to a third FLAG bit, of whether to tell the system admin, or both user and system admin.
